XRIPL (read as "zripple") is a library of tools for processing x-ray
radiographs and extracting contours of interest within the image using
computer vision techniques. Features include spatial calibration, denoising,
background and attenuation correction through pseudo-flatfielding, watershed
segmentation, contour processing, and visualization. The details of the XRIPL
analysis pipeline are published in the Proceedings of the 23rd Topical
Conference on High-Temperature Plasma Diagnostics Proceedings [1].
